### Line plots

# In the video you saw how to make line plots using time series data. 
# To explore this topic, you'll use the economics data frame, 
# which contains time series for unemployment and population statistics from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in the US.
# The data is contained in the ggplot2 package.

# look at how the median unemployment time and the unemployment rate
# (the number of unemployed people as a proportion of the population) change over time.

# In the next exercises, you'll explore to how add embellishments to the line plots, such as recession periods.

### Instructions

# 1. Print out the head() of the economics data frame.
# 2. Use the economics data frame to plot date on the x axis and unemploy on the y-axis. Use geom_line().
# 3. Copy, paste and adjust the code for the previous instruction: instead of unemploy, 
# ...plot unemploy/pop to represent the fraction of the total population that is unemployed.
