1 - Execute head(ChickWeight) to check the first few rows of this dataset. Looks like the data is pretty tidy!
2 - Plot a line for each chick.
Use ggplot() and map Time to x and weight to y within the aes() function.
Add geom_line() at the end to draw the lines.
To draw one line per chick, add group = Chick to the aes() of geom_line().
Oops! That looks pretty chaotic and you can't really conclude anything from it. Let's try again.
3 - Take plot 2 and add color = Diet within the aes() of ggplot(). There's some more information here, although it would be better to have some summary statistics as well. What do you think would be helpful?
4 - Take plot 3 and add geom_smooth() with attributes lwd set to 2 and se set to FALSE. Inside geom_line(), set alpha of to 0.3.
