# Course Description
* The ability to produce meaningful and beautiful data visualizations is an essential part of your skill set as a data scientist. 
* This course, the first R data visualization tutorial in the series, introduces you to the principles of good visualizations and the grammar of graphics plotting concepts implemented in the ggplot2 package. 
* ggplot2 has become the go-to tool for flexible and professional plots in R. Here, we’ll examine the first three essential layers for making a plot - Data, Aesthetics and Geometries. By the end of the course you will be able to make complex exploratory plots.

## CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
* In this chapter we’ll get you into the right frame of mind for developing meaningful visualizations with R. 
* You’ll understand that as a communications tool, visualizations require you to think about your audience first. You’ll also be introduced to the basics of ggplot2 - the 7 different grammatical elements (layers) and aesthetic mappings.
## CHAPTER 2 Data
* The structure of your data will dictate how you construct plots in ggplot2. 
* In this chapter, you’ll explore the iris dataset from several different perspectives to showcase this concept. 
* You’ll see that making your data conform to a structure that matches the plot in mind will make the task of visualization much easier through several R data visualization examples.
## CHAPTER 3 Aesthetics
* Aesthetic mappings are the cornerstone of the grammar of graphics plotting concept. 
* This is where the magic happens - converting continuous and categorical data into visual scales that provide access to a large amount of information in a very short time. 
* In this chapter you’ll understand how to choose the best aesthetic mappings for your data.
## CHAPTER 4 Geometries
* A plot’s geometry dictates what visual elements will be used. 
* In this chapter, we’ll familiarize you with the geometries used in the three most common plot types you’ll encounter - scatter plots, bar charts and line plots. We’ll look at a variety of different ways to construct these plots.
## CHAPTER 5 gplot and Wrap-up
* In this chapter you'll learn about qplot; it is a quick and dirty form of ggplot2. It’s not as intuitive as the full-fledged ggplot() function but may be useful in specific instances. This chapter also features a wrap-up video and corresponding data visualization exercises.
