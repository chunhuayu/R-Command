# You'll consider the last two here with the diamonds dataset:
# ...........Large datasets.
# ...........Aligned data values on a single axis

### Instructions 
# The diamonds data frame is available in the ggplot2 package. 
# Begin by making a basic scatter plot of price (y) vs. carat (x) and map clarity onto color.

# Copy the above functions and set the alpha to 0.5. This is a good start to dealing with the large dataset.
# Align all the diamonds within a clarity class, by plotting carat (y) vs. clarity (x). Map price onto color. alpha = 0.5.
# In the previous plot, all the individual values line up on a single axis within each clarity category, 
# so you have not overcome overplotting. Modify the above plot to use the position = "jitter" inside geom_point().


### R
