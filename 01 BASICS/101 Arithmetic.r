# Arithmetic with R
# In its most basic form, R can be used as a simple calculator. Consider the following arithmetic operators:

# Addition: +
# Subtraction: -
# Multiplication: *
# Division: /
# Exponentiation: ^
# Modulo: %%
# The last two might need some explaining:

# The ^ operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 3^2 is 9.
# The modulo returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, 
# for example 5 modulo 3 or 5 %% 3 is 2.
