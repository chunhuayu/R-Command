# Course Description
* The intermediate R course is the logical next stop on your journey in the R programming language. 
* In this R training you will learn about conditional statements, loops and functions to power your own R scripts. 
* Next, you can make your R code more efficient and readable using the apply functions. 
* Finally, the utilities chapter gets you up to speed with regular expressions in the R programming language, data structure manipulations and times and dates. 
* This R tutorial will allow you to learn R and take the next step in advancing your overall knowledge and capabilities while programming in R.

## Chapter 1 Conditionals and Control Flow
* To be TRUE or not be TRUE, that's the question. In this chapter you'll learn about relational operators to see how R objects compare and logical operators to combine logicals. Next, you'll use this knowledge to build conditional statements.
## Chapter 2 Loops
* Loops can come in handy on numerous occasions. While loops are like repeated if statements; the for loop is designed to iterate over all elements in a sequence. Learn all about them in this chapter.
## Chapter 3 Functions
* Functions are an extremely important concept in almost every programming language; R is not different. After learning what a function is and how you can use one, you'll take full control by writing your own functions.
## Chapter 4 The apply family
* Whenever you're using a for loop, you might want to revise your code and see whether you can use the lapply function instead. Learn all about this intuitive way of applying a function over a list or a vector, and its variants sapply and vapply.
## Chapter 5 Utilities
* Mastering R programming is not only about understanding its programming concepts. Also a solid knowledge of a wide range of R functions is useful. This chapter introduces you to a bunch of useful functions for data structure manipulation, regular expressions and working with times and dates.
