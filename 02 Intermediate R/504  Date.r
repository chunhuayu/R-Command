### Time Date
# In R, dates are represented by Date objects, while times are represented by POSIXct objects. Under the hood, 
# however, these dates and times are simple numerical values. Date objects store the number of days 
# since the 1st of January in 1970. POSIXct objects on the other hand, 
# store the number of seconds since the 1st of January in 1970.ðŸ˜”

# The 1st of January in 1970 is the common origin for representing times and dates in a wide range of programming languages. 
# There is no particular reason for this; it is a simple convention. Of course, 
# it's also possible to create dates and times before 1970; the corresponding numerical values are simply negative in this case.

### Create and format dates

# To create a Date object from a simple character string in R, you can use the as.Date() function. 
# The character string has to obey a format that can be defined using a set of symbols (the examples correspond to 13 January, 
# 1982):

%Y: 4-digit year (1982)
%y: 2-digit year (82)
%m: 2-digit month (01)
%d: 2-digit day of the month (13)
%A: weekday (Wednesday)
%a: abbreviated weekday (Wed)
%B: month (January)
%b: abbreviated month (Jan)

# The following R commands will all create the same Date object for the 13th day in January of 1982:

as.Date("1982-01-13")
as.Date("Jan-13-82", format = "%b-%d-%y")
as.Date("13 January, 1982", format = "%d %B, %Y")

# Notice that the first line here did not need a format argument, 
# because by default R matches your character string to the formats "%Y-%m-%d" or "%Y/%m/%d".

# In addition to creating dates, you can also convert dates to character strings that use a different date notation.
# For this, you use the format() function. Try the following lines of code:

today <- Sys.Date()
format(Sys.Date(), format = "%d %B, %Y")
format(Sys.Date(), format = "Today is a %A!")

### Instructions
# (1)
# Ask R for the current date, and store the result in a variable today.
# To see what today looks like under the hood, call unclass() on it.
# Ask R for the current time, and store the result in a variable, now.
# To see the numerical value that corresponds to now, call unclass() on it.
# (2)
# In the editor on the right, three character strings representing dates have been created. Convert them to dates using as.
# Date(), and assign them to date1, date2, and date3 respectively. The code for date1 is already included.
# Extract useful information from the dates as character strings using format(). From the first date, select the weekday.
# From the second date, select the day of the month. From the third date, 
# you should select the abbreviated month and the 4-digit year, separated by a space.
